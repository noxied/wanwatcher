### Reporting Bugs

Found a bug? Please help us fix it!

**Before submitting a bug report:**
- Check the [existing issues](https://github.com/noxied/wanwatcher/issues) to avoid duplicates
- Try the latest version to see if the bug still exists
- Collect information about your setup

**How to submit a good bug report:**

1. Use the bug report template (if available)
2. Include a clear, descriptive title
3. Describe the expected vs actual behavior
4. Provide steps to reproduce
5. Include logs (redact sensitive info!)
6. Specify your environment:
   - OS and version
   - Docker version (if using Docker)
   - Python version (if traditional)
   - WANwatcher version

**Example:**

```markdown
**Description:** Container exits immediately after starting

**Expected:** Container should run continuously

**Actual:** Container stops after 2 seconds

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Run: docker run -d -e DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL="..." noxied/wanwatcher:latest
2. Check: docker ps -a
3. Container shows as "Exited"

**Logs:**
```

- WANwatcher: 1.0.0
```

## üí° Suggesting Features

Have an idea for a new feature?

**Before suggesting:**
- Check [existing issues](https://github.com/noxied/wanwatcher/issues) for similar suggestions
- Consider if it fits the project scope

**How to suggest a feature:**

1. Open a new issue with a clear title
2. Describe the feature in detail
3. Explain the use case / why it's useful
4. Provide examples if possible
5. Consider implementation challenges

**Example:**

```markdown
**Feature:** Add Telegram notification support

**Use Case:** 
Users who prefer Telegram over Discord should be able to receive notifications via Telegram bot.

**Proposed Implementation:**
- Add TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN and TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID environment variables
- Create telegram notification function similar to Discord webhook
- Allow both Discord and Telegram simultaneously

**Benefits:**
- More notification options
- Broader user base
- Similar implementation to Discord

**Considerations:**
- Need to handle Telegram API rate limits
- Requires python-telegram-bot library
- Should be optional (not required)
```

## üíª Development Setup

### Traditional Development

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/wanwatcher.git
cd wanwatcher

# Create virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install requests

# Optional: Install ipinfo
pip install ipinfo

# Run the script
python3 wanwatcher.py
```

### Docker Development

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/wanwatcher.git
cd wanwatcher

# Build local image
docker build -t wanwatcher-dev .

# Test the image
docker run --rm \
  -e DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL="your_webhook" \
  wanwatcher-dev
```

### Testing Changes

**Manual Testing:**

1. Test traditional installation:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/install.sh
   python3 /root/wanwatcher/wanwatcher.py
   ```

2. Test Docker:
   ```bash
   docker build -t wanwatcher-test .
   docker run --rm -e DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL="..." wanwatcher-test
   ```

3. Test different scenarios:
   - First run (no previous IP)
   - IP change
   - Network errors
   - Invalid webhook
   - With/without ipinfo token

## üé® Code Style

### Python Style

Follow PEP 8 guidelines:

- **Indentation:** 4 spaces (no tabs)
- **Line length:** Max 100 characters (prefer 80)
- **Naming:**
  - Variables/functions: `snake_case`
  - Constants: `UPPER_CASE`
  - Classes: `PascalCase`

**Example:**

```python
# Good
def get_current_ip():
    """Get current WAN IP address"""
    try:
        response = requests.get(IP_SERVICE_URL, timeout=10)
        return response.json()['ip']
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Failed to get IP: {e}")
        return None

# Bad
def GetCurrentIP():
    response=requests.get(IP_SERVICE_URL)
    return response.json()['ip']
```

### Documentation

- **Docstrings** for all functions
- **Comments** for complex logic
- **Clear variable names** (no single letters except loops)

### Shell Scripts

- Use `#!/bin/bash`
- Add comments for complex commands
- Use `set -e` for error handling
- Quote variables: `"$VARIABLE"`
